## Why
- Some vintage speakers use ferrofluid that can dry up to transport sound in the tweeter
- The tweeters stop working due to the dry liquid
- My B&W DM7 desperately need ferrofluid replacement, but may also need a new silk diaphragm

## How do I get it
- Speaker ferrofluid is _not_ just any ferrofluid
- Viscosity depends on whether it is for midrange og tweeters

- This stuff is 20€ for 1 ml so beware!!! That's €20,000 per liter...
