## I need to find a foodgrade watersprayer

- Must be truly cleansible
- Could try a small food-grade oil bottle and fill in water

## Uses
- Baking crispbread, bran flakes, thin cookies without rolling out the dough
- Try to achieve non-stick effect from water placed above oil on a baking tray (with no sheet?)
