# **Movies**

**\- Morning cinema in Grand Teatret:** In all days of the week, go to the beautiful 'small' Grand Teatret for a morning movie at around 70kr. Including coffee. Bonus tip: If you are a Politiken Reader, keep an eye in their two movies of the month, where you get 2 tickets at half the price. You can combine the two offers! Unheard of...

\- **Cinemateket**, the state funded Danish Film Institute cinema offers great movies, festivals and events, sometimes including food and wine. I have been a member for more than ten years and regularly enjoy their movie of the month for free with a few friends. Beware: some of these films are really odd!
