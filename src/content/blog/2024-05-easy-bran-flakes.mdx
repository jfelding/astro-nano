# Recipe: Spray-On Bran Flakes

## Introduction:
Tired of shelling out for store-bought bran flakes that are too sweet? Want to whip up your own crunchy, fiber-packed cereal hassle-free? 
This recipe for Spray-On Bran Flakes offers an easy approach to crafting healthy breakfast. 
With a mix of oat bran, whole wheat flour, and a sprinkle of flax seeds, these homemade bran flakes are sure to win over your taste buds. Let's dive in!

## Ingredients:
- 150g Oat bran
- 150g Whole wheat flour
- 1 tsp Baking soda
- 2 Tbsp Powdered flax seeds
- 5g Sugar (powdered or blended)
- Water (for spraying)
- Oil (for spraying)

## Instructions:
1. **Preheat Oven**: Heat your oven to 150¬∞C (300¬∞F). 

2. **Prepare Baking Sheet**: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Give it a spritz of cooking oil using a spray bottle or brush, then spray with lots of water.

3. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a bowl, mix dry ingredients.

4. **Spread**: Pour out the dry ingredients mixture on the wet baking sheet. Even it by hand to make a thin layer.

5. **Spray with water**: Fiercely spray the mixture with a strong water sprayer. It must be completely wet with no dry patches.

6. **Flatten**: Tap the dough to flatten and find any dry spots that may need extra water spraying.

7. **Spray with oil**: Spray a little bit of oil on top.

8. **Bake**: Pop the baking sheet in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. The time depends a lot on the amount of water you used. When slightly browned, see if you can flip the dough and bake until crisp on both sides. I do it by hand.

9. **Cool flakes**: Once done, let the bran flakes cool completely on the pan to crisp up. Break the baked mixture into flakes. If you are not satisfied with the crispness, bake the flakes little longer.

## Notes:
- Adjust sweetness by tweaking the amount of powdered sugar to your liking, or use funky types of sugars for a caramel twist.
- Make sure the flakes are fully cooled before storing to maintain crunch.
- You need a **strong** water sprayer for this recipe to work well. Preferrably certified food grade.
