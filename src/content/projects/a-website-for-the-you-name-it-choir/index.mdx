## What should the choir web page be used for?
- outreach
- posting the website on facebook for more information about the choir
- a description of our choir for when we are accepting new members
- nice pictures and links to videos/music (hosted elsewhere, perhaps)
- a google calendar (with [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/)) of our upcoming events, (open) practice sessions, choir weekends, etc.

## How should it be made?
- statically, because that's all we'll ever need
- ideally with a headless CMS (Decap) so that other choir members can edit the site without my help.
- with Tailwind CSS or something better that I don't yet know of

## What is a to-do-list for the project?
- find an astro theme, possibly [AstroWind](https://astro.build/themes/details/astrowind/) (preferably something that uses Tailwind CSS)
- make a very simple site to display in our choir weekend trip
- add links to our facebook site, including upcoming events
- bring camera on weekend trip to take nice images of us
- decide on a domain name (voting among the choir)
- nice-to-have: Google Calendar with a simple full-calendar display
