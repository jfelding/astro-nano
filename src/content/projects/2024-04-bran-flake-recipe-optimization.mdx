## The idea
Inspired by a surprisingly successful [spray-on crispbread](../blog/01-the-easiest-crispbread-youll-find), 
I want to create a recipe for spray-on branflakes.

I have made homemade branflakes before. The content is simple and healthy, usually bran, flour and a little sirup sweetener. 
But it took some effort which meant that I didn't have the energy to make it more than twice this way.

Now I'm thinking that bran flakes are basically small peaces of crispbread, so why not repeat the success of spray-on bran flakes?

## Sweetener options
My spray-on baking approach is:

  - combine dry ingredients
  - spread out on a baking tray (with oil, then water sprayed on top)
  - spray the top with water
  - bake

Now, the question is, how do we add sirup sweetener, or do we use an alternative sweetener?

I think we have two main options:
  - use sirup sweeter mixed into the water in the correct ratio (requires an easily cleansable sprayer)
  - just blend up some sugar(s) like muscovado and cane sugar, and combine it in the dry ingredients.

I'm thinking that the second option is way easier to do right. I usually don't measure the water needed to be sprayed on exactly, 
so how would I know that I have added enough sweetener mixed into the water?
